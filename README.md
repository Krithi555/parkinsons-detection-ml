Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech. Early detection plays a crucial role in managing the disease and improving the quality of life of patients.This project focuses on detecting Parkinson’s disease using Machine Learning techniques, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on clinical voice measurements to classify whether a person has Parkinson’s disease or not.
